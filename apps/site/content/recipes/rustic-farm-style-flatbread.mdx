# Rustic Farm-Style Flatbread

> A quick, no-fuss flatbread perfect for accompanying cheeses, dips or grilled meats.

1. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a bowl, combine flour, salt and baking powder.
2. **Add liquids:** Stir in water and olive oil until a shaggy dough forms.
3. **Shape & cook:** Divide dough into 6 pieces. On a floured surface, press each into a 15 cm flat disc. Cook on a hot, dry skillet for 2–3 minutes per side until puffed and golden.
4. **Serve warm:** Brush with extra olive oil and top with sea salt or your favourite toppings.
